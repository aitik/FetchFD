# Dog Breed Gallery App

Welcome to the Dog Breed Gallery App as a submission for the take home test for Fetch Frontend Intern position! This React application allows you to view images of your favorite dog breeds using Dog API.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to download and run the app on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aitik/FetchFD.git
   
2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start

4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

And there you can select one or more dog breeds from the dropdown and see images of your selected breeds. 3 images per breed and the label of the breed should dinamically show up/disappear from the gallery so you don't have to refresh the page.
